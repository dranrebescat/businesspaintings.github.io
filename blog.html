                    <p>I’m already running out of space, and there’s a lot more good stuff to talk about. So, as briefly as possible:

Gary Petersen recently added planar shapes to his usual repertory of bands and frames. It doesn’t sound like a big leap but the results are impressive – his aptly title The Space Between at Brian Morris Gallery (in a group show aptly titled Space Matters) is spatially intriguing – it’s a bit like peering through slats in a fence and getting fleeting glimpses of another world. Edward Thorp started the season with a group show as well, entitled Junction. I really enjoyed Jason Stopa’s canvases – he’s coming off a solid solo effort at Novella Gallery, and the big space at Thorp gave him the opportunity to increase the scale. Leopard Skin Rug was my favorite entry of his – it had all the colors one would find in a creamsicle, and used black shark teeth as framing devices. It was playful in the best sense, and that’s Stopa’s greatest asset. Philippe Decrauzat showed some terrific moiré paintings at Elizabeth Dee, which were somewhat marred by silly hanging – there were skinny false walls, and some pictures were at the floor, others at the ceiling. They didn’t need the theatrical flourish. Stephen Maine put up an excellent show of process-driven abstractions earlier this year at 490 Atlantic, with motifs reminiscent of commercial printing gone awry. In his current show at Melville House, he’s added a few new devices (literally and figuratively). I really like the way that he wields a dot screen, especially in close value. The orangey dots over a green ground in the aggressive HP14-0605 buzzed like a swarm of bees. Vince Contarino has shown a string of really good paintings in the last year, first in a three person show at Stephan Stoyanov, and more recently in a solo exhibition at TSA. The big blue Missing Pieces from the latter show got a second airing at the BRIC Biennial; its geometry, gesture, and transparency were all woven together with confidence and maturity.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>George Hofmann and Ben Dowell at first glance seem like an unlikely pairing in their two-person show at Ventana244. But in much the same way that Douglas Melini was able to bridge highly disparate types of paint application via analogy of color, these two painters’ palettes make the show cohere in spite of their radically different approaches. Hofmann applies high-key color gesturally over exposed plywood supports, then uses several methods of removal to take paint away – the erasure is as important as the application. The result is candy colored ghosts that seems to be disappearing into the surface of the wood. The edges are mainly left untouched, and here the wood becomes hard and corporeal again – that magical change from misty illusionism to obdurate physicality is a real feat. I really liked Way After 2 from 2014; its center was barely defined by the wispiest pale yellow. In contrast to Hofmann’s ethereal gestures, Dowell paints impossibly thick impasto over the entire surface of his symmetrical, geometrically derived compositions. This is dangerous territory, but his use of light color together with the implied transparency (!) he gets from sequential arrangement of hue keeps the pictures from feeling heavy or clotted. Small notes of darker color are used throughout as anchors, nicely exemplified in the zig-zaggy Untitled from 2014 – the darker reds and blues framed the composition without making it feel boxed in.</p>

                    <p>This is quite a tricky question because I like to think I go into the studio to paint… and if I did not go to do that then nothing else would be sparked into motion. I would not learn from what I find. This reminds me of something that is understood in psychoanalytic thought – to beware of the idea of &lsquo;I am the kind of person who…&rsquo;</p>
